## About Me

Augusto Santos Rampasso is a PhD candidate in Entomology at Cornell University. His research interests taxonomy, systematics, and evolution of Drosophilidae (Diptera), with a focus on natural populations. He integrates field collections and taxonomy with phylogenetic inference to study Drosophilidae diversification through biogeographic patterns, evolution of morphological traits, and the formation of new species.
