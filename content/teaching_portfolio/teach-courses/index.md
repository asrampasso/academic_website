## Course Level
Undergraduate students.

## Number of Students
20-30 students.

## Class Time
50 minutes.

## Lecture Description
This lecture was designed to teach basic evolution concepts for undergraduate students. It includes definitions of species (and their limitations), and the mechanisms by which populations may diverge and originate new species. This lecture brings research case studies from across the world, and invites students to discuss relevant topics in small groups, which are subsequently shared with the entire class.

## Learning Goals
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
 - Analyze multiple species concepts and their limitations.
 - Understand how new species originate.
 - Evaluate the roles of speciation and extinction rates in the biodiversity maintenance in our planet.
